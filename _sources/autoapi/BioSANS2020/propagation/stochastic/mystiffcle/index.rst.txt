                     This module is the mystiffcle module

   This can propagate non-stiff to moderately stiff stochastic simulation
   using the chemical langevine equation. Here two versions are provided

   1) Tau-adaptive CLE
   2) Fix-inreval CLE

   The following are the list of function for this module.
